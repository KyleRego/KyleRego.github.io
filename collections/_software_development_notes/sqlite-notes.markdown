SQLite provides a relational database management system (RDBMS) that has a dynamic type system and does not use a client/server architecture. The database (the definition of the database schema as well as the data) is itself just a single file, which conveniently is cross-platform. It is also possible to use a SQLite database as an in-memory object/data structure.

# sqlite3

This is a command line tool for interacting with a SQLite database. It is like the `mysql` and `pgsql` applications.

{% highlight console %}
 $ sqlite3 collection.anki21
{% endhighlight %}

The `collection.anki21` file is a SQLite database. I exported some old cards from Anki that I had tagged "sql" and then unzipped the resulting `*.apkg` file to get this to use as an example.

This shell shows the `sqlite>` prompt to which you can give dot-commands or SQL commands. `.exit` or `.quit` will exit the sqlite3 interface. `.headers on` and `.mode column` make the output easier to read. `.schema` will output the DDL SQL statements (like `CREATE TABLE`) used to define the database schema. `.dump` dumps all the SQL needed to recreate both the schema and the data. `.read filename` can be used to execute a list of dot-commands and SQL statements from a file. To see a list of all the dot-commands, use `.help`.

## Example

{% highlight console %}
 $ sqlite3 collection.anki21
SQLite version 3.37.2 2022-01-06 13:25:41
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> select id, tags, sfld from notes;
id             tags   sfld

# System Catalogs

These are data structures which keep system state data. In SQLite, they start with the prefix `sqlite_`. The most important one is the `sqlite_master` table, which has five columns: `type`, `name`, `tbl_name`, `rootpage`, and `sql`. `name` and `tbl_name` will have the same value for tables. The `sql` column usually holds the original SQL statement used to create the object, but it will reflect any modifications such as `ALTER TABLE` commands applied to a table after the original `CREATE TABLE`.
