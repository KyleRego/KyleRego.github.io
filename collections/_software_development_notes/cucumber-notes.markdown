Cucumber is a behaviour-driven development tool that parses feature tests written in plaintext Gherkin language into programmatic step definitions.

There are many benefits to this approach:
- It allows all members of the team to contribute to writing the tests
- It provides business logic documentation that does not become outdated
- It allows demonstration that the acceptance critera has been met if the acceptance criteria is written into the tests
