[Launch School](https://launchschool.com) is a website that teaches a course on web development fundamentals ([it is not a coding bootcamp](https://medium.com/launch-school/were-not-a-bootcamp-c33901412c38)). Instead of focusing on any particular frameworks, the focus is on topics that don't change as quickly. I took the Ruby version of the course, but there is a separate track for people interested in Node instead of Ruby.

The order of topics is roughly:
- the Ruby programming language
- object-oriented programming
- the Internet, the Internet protocol suite, HTTP, and TLS
- web applications with Sinatra
- SQL with Postgres
- applications that interact with a database using [the `pg` gem](https://github.com/ged/ruby-pg)
- HTML and CSS
- the JavaScript programming language
- object-oriented programming (again but with JavaScript)
- the DOM and asynchronous programming

The Launch School course does a great job including a lot of practice problems and exercises throughout. Some are classics, like implementing a sorting algorithm or linked list, while others have you designing a simple command line game or trying to spot a subtle logical error in a code snippet. I also found the course to be heavy in reading and light in watching videos compared to other resources, which I appreciated.

One thing to note is you need to pass assessments to progress to the next topic (and the lowest passing grade is like an A-). Each assessment is a live coding interview, a written assessment, or a project. At certain points in the course, you have to pass more than one of these to continue. While I never failed an assessment, they are generally not easy, and people do commonly fail them.

For me, the Launch School course was a worthwhile investment. The topics covered are solid, the amount of practice is more than sufficent, and the assessments guarantee you will not pass without many of the necessary skills to work as a web developer.

If you want to see what they're about for yourself, check out [Launch School's open book shelf](https://launchschool.com/books) which has some short and sweet (and free) books covering topics like the command line, git, HTTP, and regular expressions.

My review on this course: it's a buy.
