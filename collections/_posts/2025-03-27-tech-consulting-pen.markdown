Do you ever have a pen and it's a precious thing which you don't want to lose, but you know it is inevitable it will be lost one day?

These days, I've been thankful for my pen that Tech Consulting (company who I worked for 1 month in Atlanta, GA) gave me.

Tech Consulting for me was one of those short jobs that just didn't work out, I was an employee for 1 month. I had ethical reasons to not continue with the company which for me was very helpful to move states which was what I wanted to do at the time, and that turned out to be a good step forward for me even if the job didn't work out.
