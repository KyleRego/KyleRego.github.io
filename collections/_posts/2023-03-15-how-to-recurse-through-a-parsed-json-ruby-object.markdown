I had to do something today that the easiest way I could think of involved iterating through all of the values in some parsed JSON Ruby objects. This problem was very similar to one I solved a long time ago: [counting the number of times a symbol appears in an S-expression](/how-to-design-programs). This post shows the method (after a little refactoring) I wrote to solve this problem.

*TODO: Is the approach here pretty pointless if a standard library thing I don't know about does the same thing and would be more obvious? Even so, the method here is somewhat interesting and the post is a good review of JSON, recursion, and Ruby closures.*

The first thing is understanding the data type of the argument. `JSON.parse` parses a raw JSON string argument into a Ruby object, so we need to understand JSON, and the return value of `JSON.parse` which will be the argument to our method.

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is one of the following:
- an array of values
- an object of keys and values.

The keys are always strings and the values may be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or `null`. It is easy to see how each is parsed into Ruby with irb:

{% highlight ruby %}
:001 > require "json"
 => true
:002 > array_json = ["hello", "world"].to_json
 => "[\"hello\",\"world\"]"
:003 > JSON.parse(array_json)
 => ["hello", "world"]
:004 > object_json = { "hello" => "world", "foo" => "bar" }.to_json
 => "{\"hello\":\"world\",\"foo\":\"bar\"}"
:005 > JSON.parse object_json
 => {"hello"=>"world", "foo"=>"bar"}
:006 > json = [nil].to_json
 => "[null]"
:007 > JSON.parse json
 => [nil]
{% endhighlight %}

The method we want to write will take the Ruby object (the parsed JSON object--an array or hash) as argument. However, the values of the array or hash can also be arrays and hashes, which also have values which can be arrays and hashes, and so on. The solution I came up with is straightforward after understanding the recursive data type of the argument (straightforward if you are comfortable with closures in Ruby at least):

```ruby
def recurse_through(arg, &closure)
  if arg.instance_of?(Hash)
    arg.each_value { |value| recurse_through(value, &closure) }
  elsif arg.instance_of?(Array)
    arg.each { |value| recurse_through(value, &closure) }
  else
    yield arg
  end
end
```

That's pretty much it. The following shows it works (I don't know any edge cases yet):

```ruby
hash1 = {
  hello: "world_1",
  world: {
    hello: {
      hello: "world_a",
      world: "hello_b",
      world_2: {
        world: :hello_symbol
      }
    }
  },
  array: ["yes_1", "no_1", "yes_2", "no_2"],
  array_of_hashes: [
    {a: "b_1", b: "a_2"}
  ]
}

recurse_through(hash1) do |value|
  puts "This value was #{value}"
end
# This value was world_1
# This value was world_a
# This value was hello_b
# This value was hello_symbol
# This value was yes_1
# This value was no_1
# This value was yes_2
# This value was no_2
# This value was b_1
# This value was a_2

hash2 = {
  a: {
    hi: "mom",
    santa: "clause"
  },
  b: {
    a: ["this be in array"],
    b: ["this be in the other array"],
    c: [
      {
        and: "this be in the hash in the third array"
      }
    ]
  },
  c: "yep"
}

recurse_through(hash2) do |value|
  puts "And this value was #{value}"
  puts "yep"
end
# And this value was mom
# yep
# And this value was clause
# yep
# And this value was this be in array
# yep
# And this value was this be in the other array
# yep
# And this value was this be in the hash in the third array
# yep
# And this value was yep
# yep

array = ["this works too", { yes: "yes sir"}]

recurse_through(array) do |value|
  2.times { puts value }
end
# this works too
# this works too
# yes sir
# yes sir

count = 0
recurse_through([hash1, hash2, array]) { |_| count += 1 }
puts "There were a total of #{count} values in those 3 objects."
# There were a total of 18 values in those 3 objects.

```

Results may vary when it comes to performance. I imagine this could overflow the call stack with a large enough JSON object, for example. Hope this helps!
