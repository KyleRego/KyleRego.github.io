I used the STI pattern in my little Rails app today, the second time I used this in a Rails app and I really like the pattern. The first time it was a lot harder since I was refactoring some existing tables into the new STI table and the app already had production data that had to be moved to the new table carefully. The [Rails API documentation on the STI pattern](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Inheritance.html) is pretty short and worth reading if you develop with Rails and haven't already.

It just involves having a table with a `type` column, and the values for that column will be the names of the child classes derived from a model class corresponding to that table with the Active Record O/RM (a model `Ingredient` corresponds to the `ingredients` table). In my case today, the table was `ingredients` for the parent class `Ingredient` with 4 child classes. In the current `schema.rb` file here is the table:

{% highlight ruby %}
create_table "ingredients", force: :cascade do |t|
  t.string "name", null: false
  t.integer "category_id"
  t.datetime "created_at", null: false
  t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  t.string "type", null: false
  t.boolean "available", default: true
  t.integer "count", default: 0
  t.string "volume_unit"
  t.float "volume_amount", default: 0.0
  t.string "weight_unit"
  t.float "weight_amount", default: 0.0
end
{% endhighlight %}

The `type` column determines what class is used to instantiate the object corresponding to the database record. Those derived classes have attributes specific to them (for example here, `volume_amount` is for `VolumeIngredient`) but all the attributes are stored in the same table. Here are the models derived from `Ingredient`:

{% highlight ruby %}
class CountIngredient < Ingredient; end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class ExcessIngredient < Ingredient; end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class VolumeIngredient < Ingredient
  def self.volume_units
    ["ml", "cups"]
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
class WeightIngredient < Ingredient
  def self.weight_units
    ["gram", "lb"]
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

With my design, ingredients are created with a name and a type:

![Form to create an ingrediant](assets/sti-example-in-rails/image1.png)

The data posted from that select form element is really `VolumeIngredient` if the user selects `Volume` there.

I decided to use the `ingredients#show` in the following way:

{% highlight erb %}
<div class="mb-4 flex align-items-center">
  <h1 class="fs-10 border-bottom-2 border-right-2 border-black border-style-groove mr-4 pr-2 pb-2">
    <%= @ingredient.name %>
  </h1>

  <% if @ingredient.type == "CountIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/count/description" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "ExcessIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/excess/description" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "VolumeIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/volume/description" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "WeightIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/weight/description" %>
  <% end %>

  <p style="color: green" class="ml-2">
    <%= notice %>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="p-2 border-around-1 border-style-solid">
  <% if @ingredient.type == "CountIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/count/form" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "ExcessIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/excess/form" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "VolumeIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/volume/form" %>
  <% elsif @ingredient.type == "WeightIngredient" %>
    <%= render partial: "ingredients/show/weight/form" %>
  <% end %>
</div>

<div class="mt-2 flex justify-around">
  <%= link_to "Back to ingredients", ingredients_path %>

  <%= button_to "Destroy this ingredient", ingredient_path(@ingredient), method: :delete %>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

I like organizing view code of partials into subdirectories named after the action if they are only used in one in general.

![Picture showing the directory structure in the IDE alongside the code of the show template](assets/sti-example-in-rails/image2.png)

But the main thing is the template uses the partials in a very structured way that reflects the STI. The `ingredients#show` action responds to a GET request to `ingredient_path(@ingredient)` for any ingredient type. Simply checking the type of the ingredient in the template and rendering the version of the partial for that ingredient type allows for this sort of thing:

![What ingredients#show looks like for an ingredient with type "CountIngredient"](assets/sti-example-in-rails/image3.png)

![What ingredients#show looks like for an ingredient with type "VolumeIngredient"](assets/sti-example-in-rails/image4.png)

![What ingredients#show looks like for an ingredient with type "ExcessIngredient"](assets/sti-example-in-rails/image5.png)

The one for type "WeightIngredient" is pretty similar to the volume one. Here's an example of the `_form.html.erb` (in the `weight` folder):

{% highlight erb %}
<%= form_with model: @ingredient, url: weight_ingredient_path(@ingredient) do |form| %>
  <p class="text-align-center">
    Use this form to update the amount and unit of measurement.
  </p>

  <div class="flex justify-center mt-2">

    <div class="flex justify-center mr-12">
      <div class="flex align-items-center mr-4">
        <%= form.label :weight_amount, "Amount:" %>
        <%= form.number_field :weight_amount,
                step: "any",
                min: 0,
                class: "ml-2",
                required: true %>
      </div>

      <div class="flex align-items-center">
        <%= form.label :weight_unit, "Unit:" %>
        <%= select_tag "weight_ingredient[weight_unit]",
            options_for_select(WeightIngredient.weight_units, @ingredient.weight_unit),
            prompt: "Select a unit:",
            title: "Select a unit:",
            required: true,
            class: "ml-2" %>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <%= form.submit "Submit" %>
    </div>

  </div>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

It sends the request to an endpoint that is specific to the ingredient type and there is a controller for each. Here are the routes:

{% highlight ruby %}
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  ...
  resources :ingredients
  patch "/excess_ingredients/:id", to: "excess_ingredients#update", as: "excess_ingredient"
  patch "/count_ingredients/:id", to: "count_ingredients#update", as: "count_ingredient"
  patch "/volume_ingredients/:id", to: "volume_ingredients#update", as: "volume_ingredient"
  patch "/weight_ingredients/:id", to: "weight_ingredients#update", as: "weight_ingredient"
  ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

And one of the controllers:

{% highlight ruby %}
# frozen_string_literal: true

class WeightIngredientsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_ingredient

  def update
    if @ingredient.update(ingredient_params)
      redirect_to ingredient_url(@ingredient), notice: "Ingredient was successfully updated."
    else
      render :show, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private
    def set_ingredient
      @ingredient = WeightIngredient.find(params[:id])
    end

    def ingredient_params
      params.require(:weight_ingredient).permit(:weight_amount, :weight_unit)
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

# Summary

Rails makes the STI pattern about as easy as it could be to implement (just have a table with a `type` column, child classes of the model of that table, and put the names of those child classes in that `type` column). Then a simple implementation to reflect that in the view layer is to just implement the same partial once for each type wherever the UI in a template should vary with the type. I always find code with a structure that has a clear relationship to the data's structure to be elegant and with STI there are many ways that could manifest itself including the simple design shown here.
