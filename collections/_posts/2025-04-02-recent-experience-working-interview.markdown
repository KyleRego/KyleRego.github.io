Last Friday I had a "Working Interview (4:30am-6:30am)" scheduled through Indeed after an initial phone interview where the caller (and owner of the "route"--an independent company) told me to show up at a specific grocery store at 4:30am.

At about 8:40am I checked the time; it was way past being a 2 hour interview like I planned for. I had been working the whole time, pallet jacking around pallets, stocking and rotating product which was chips and tortillas, checking dates, facing the labels right, lifting, moving, stacking boxes, using a step ladder.

So as we were about to move to the next place in the store, I asked him was he going to pay me for the working interview? He told me no, anyways I signed out at 8:42am. I would have worked the whole day if he were going to pay me.

He did end up going with a different candidate. I honestly thought I was solid for what working skills I used in the 4 hour interview that started at 4:30am.

Oh wells, no hurt feelings. Just wanted to note an interesting thing that happened to me.
