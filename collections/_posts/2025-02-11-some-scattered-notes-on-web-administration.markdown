## SCP Syntax

Sometimes I waste time remembering the command to SCP a file to my server:

scp -i "C:\path_to_pem_file\file.pem" ./file.zip username@hostname:directory

- scp: secure copy command
- ./file.zip: local file being SCPed to the server
- -i "C:\path_to_pem_file\file.pem": private SSH key for authentication, in my case the Azure Portal provides this as a "pem file"
- username@hostname: your user account name on the remote machine and that machine's IP address or domain name
- directory: destination path on the server to put the file

If `ssl` is used for `directory` in the above the file will be put in `~/ssl` (directory `ssl` in the user's home directory `~`).
