For a while now the deployed version of an ASP.NET Core/React project (which uses React Router) I am working on has had this issue where a full page refresh resulted in a Not Found response from Apache if the browser address path was anything but "/". Since the app uses React Router for client-side routing, that this happened did not surprise me much, however I didn't know exactly how to address it and I procrastinated actually looking into it, but today I looked into it and worked out how to address it with the Apache configuration.

For my `sites-available/larder.conf` Apache configuration I just had to add:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ /index.html [L]
```

inside the `<VirtualHost>` block for the client (in my case the `larder.conf` has the configuration for serving the static React app as well as the ASP.NET Core API). This does require enabling the `mod_rewrite` module (`sudo a2enmod rewrite` and restarting Apache). I guess the above is a "rewrite rule."

This enables the `mod_rewrite` module's URL manipulation and redirection, with 2 conditions to continue processing the rewrite rule: if the request is not for a file that exists or a directory that exists, continue, and then the request is redirected to `index.html` which allows React Router to take over with the client-side routing.

## Few hours later update

A few hours after doing the above I noticed that a different issue was happening.

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

So some request for a missing JavaScript file was getting rewritten to the `index.html` (maybe caused by requesting a file with an old fingerprint from the cache) which the browser didn't like since it was a different MIME type.

Changing the rewrite rule to

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|ico|json|txt|woff|woff2|ttf|svg)$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ /index.html [L]
```

to exclude requests to URIs for JavaScript (as well as other things that should not be rewritten) seems to have addressed the issue.
