I noticed an issue yesterday in the production website for my Ruby on Rails app, Anki Books. I had recently migrated the website from being served from a laptop I had to the Azure VM that I was using for some other websites before I moved, and I somewhat tactically caching to the public facing controller actions. The issue that I realized yesterday was that due to an inline script using a nonce for passing the Content Security Policy, the cached result was including an outdated nonce, so the CSP was failing which was causing all of the JavaScript on the page to not work.

The nonce was needed for a script that was being used to change the Trix configuration. It was something I worked on over a year ago, but after trying other approaches that I think would have been better but I couldn't get to work, ended up an ERB partial `_trix_config.erb` which was being included in the layout of the app in the `<head>`:

{% highlight javascript %}
<%= javascript_tag nonce: true do -%> <%# erblint:disable NoJavascriptTagHelper %>
  // Changes the Trix.config to support the subheadings.
  // The order that things need to load seems to make it necessary
  // to add this to the head after the modules
  document.addEventListener("trix-before-initialize", () => {
    Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading2 = {
      tagName: "h2",
      terminal: true,
      breakOnReturn: true,
      group: false,
    };
    Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading3 = {
      tagName: "h3",
      terminal: true,
      breakOnReturn: true,
      group: false,
    };
    Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading4 = {
      tagName: "h4",
      terminal: true,
      breakOnReturn: true,
      group: false,
    };
    Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading5 = {
      tagName: "h5",
      terminal: true,
      breakOnReturn: true,
      group: false,
    };
    Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading6 = {
      tagName: "h6",
      terminal: true,
      breakOnReturn: true,
      group: false,
    };
  })
<% end -%>
{% endhighlight %}

I never really felt that approach was an ideal way to do it, but it worked, at least until adding the caching and realizing that the outdated nonce served from the cache was breaking the JavaScript.

So today I tried for a while to get this in a Stimulus controller that in the `connect()` method would add the event listener, but I found it didn't work well. The behavior seemed to vary on different page refreshes and it seemed like the `trix-before-initialize` event was firing before the Stimulus controller connected, so the event was never observed and the Trix object wasn't changed. But it turned out that simply putting this in `app/javascript/application.js` worked well:

{% highlight javascript %}
import Trix from "trix";
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading2 = {
  tagName: "h2",
  terminal: true,
  breakOnReturn: true,
  group: false,
};
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading3 = {
  tagName: "h3",
  terminal: true,
  breakOnReturn: true,
  group: false,
};
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading4 = {
  tagName: "h4",
  terminal: true,
  breakOnReturn: true,
  group: false,
};
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading5 = {
  tagName: "h5",
  terminal: true,
  breakOnReturn: true,
  group: false,
};
Trix.config.blockAttributes.heading6 = {
  tagName: "h6",
  terminal: true,
  breakOnReturn: true,
  group: false,
};
{% endhighlight %}

I was surprised it worked without the event listener as I thought that was necessary from my previous experience. I guess with this way it's changing the `Trix` object for all instances of the Trix editor, so if your app used different Trix editors that needed to have this customized differently, it wouldn't be this simple and you would probably have to customize it using that event.

This modification is used to support adding `h1` through `h6` buttons to the editor, and I also have a Stimulus controller for making various changes to the Trix editor in the DOM. It is connected to a `div` that wraps where Action Text renders the editor:

{% highlight ruby %}
<div  data-controller="article-editor"
        data-article-editor-target="editorContainer">
<%= form.label :content %>
<%= form.rich_text_area :content %>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

And so the changes to the DOM itself happen with this controller, which involves some changes that are very specific to my app, such as setting the `y` position of the toolbar to just below the header:

{% highlight javascript %}
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = [ "editorContainer" ];

  connect() {
    this.toolbarTarget = this.editorContainerTarget.querySelector("[id^='trix-toolbar-']");
    this.configureToolbar();
    this.setupHeaderButtonsGroup();
    this.addHeaderButtonsGroupToButtonsRow();
    this.removeOriginalHeadersButton();
    this.changeKeyboardShortcuts();
  }

  configureToolbar() {
    const topNavBarHeight = document.querySelector("#top-nav").offsetHeight;
    this.toolbarTarget.classList.add("position-sticky");
    this.toolbarTarget.classList.add("z-50");
    this.toolbarTarget.classList.add("bg-white");
    this.toolbarTarget.classList.add("dark:bg-gray-900");
    this.toolbarTarget.style.top = `${topNavBarHeight}px`;
  }

  setupHeaderButtonsGroup() {
    this.headersButtonGroup = document.createElement("span");
    this.headersButtonGroup.setAttribute("class", "trix-button-group");
    const headings = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"];
    headings.forEach((heading) => {
      const button = document.createElement("button");
      button.innerText = `H${heading}`;
      button.setAttribute("type", "button");
      button.setAttribute("class", "trix-button");
      button.setAttribute("data-trix-attribute", `heading${heading}`);
      button.setAttribute("title", `H${heading}`);
      button.setAttribute("tabindex", "-1");
      button.setAttribute("data-trix-active", "");
      this.headersButtonGroup.appendChild(button);
    });
  }

  addHeaderButtonsGroupToButtonsRow() {
    const buttonsRow = document.querySelector("div.trix-button-row");
    const secondButtonGroup = buttonsRow.children[1];
    secondButtonGroup.insertBefore(this.headersButtonGroup, secondButtonGroup.firstChild);
    while (this.headersButtonGroup.firstChild) {
      this.headersButtonGroup.parentNode.insertBefore(this.headersButtonGroup.firstChild, this.headersButtonGroup);
    }
    this.headersButtonGroup.parentNode.removeChild(this.headersButtonGroup);
  }

  removeOriginalHeadersButton() {
    this.showHeadersButtonGroup = this.toolbarTarget.querySelector(".trix-button--icon-heading-1");
    this.showHeadersButtonGroup.parentNode.removeChild(this.showHeadersButtonGroup);
  }

  changeKeyboardShortcuts() {
    this.changeRedoButtonKeyboardShortcut();
  }

  changeRedoButtonKeyboardShortcut() {
    const redoButton = document.querySelector("button.trix-button--icon-redo");
    redoButton.setAttribute("data-trix-key", "y");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Also, this is what the Trix editor toolbar ends up looking like in my app (it is mainly what is being changed with the above):

And with the H2 selected, other block-level buttons become disabled:
