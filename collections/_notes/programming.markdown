## Wikipedia

- [ABC Software Metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Software_Metric)
  - A vector software metric (number of assignments, number of branches, and number of conditionals) that intends to measure program size and may incidentally measure complexity. ABC vectors can be assigned to files, classes, methods etc. and added together linearly since they are vectors.
- [Active record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
- [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)
- [Big Design Up Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front)
- [Cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)
  - A software metric measuring complexity as the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code.
