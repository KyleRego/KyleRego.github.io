When I was at the beginning of teaching myself programming, I found [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) which recommended some books for learning programming. The one I ended up reading was [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/).

I think the main idea of this textbook is that the structure of the data informs the structure of the program. Designing or understanding the structure of the data is therefore critical in program design.

As an example to demonstrate this point, exercise 320 from the book asks you write a function which counts how many times a symbol appears in an S-expression. The following definition of the S-expression data type is recursive:

{% highlight racket %}
; An S-expr is one of:
; - Number
; - String
; - Symbol
; - List-of S-expr

; A List-of S-expr is one of: 
; â€“ '()
; â€“ (cons S-expr List-of S-expr)
{% endhighlight %}

In the teaching Lisp used by this textbook, the `;` starts a comment and `'()` is the empty list. `cons` constructs a list where the first argument becomes the list's first element and the second argument, a list, becomes the rest of the list's elements. These are accessed by the `first` and `rest` functions.

Here is my solution (the book encourages writing function signatures and unit testing):

{% highlight racket %}
; S-expr Symbol -> Number
; counts all occurrences of sy in sexp
(check-expect (count 'world 'hello) 0)
(check-expect (count '(world hello) 'hello) 1)
(check-expect (count '(((world) hello) hello) 'hello) 2)

(define (count sexp sy)
  (local (; [List-of S-expr] Symbol -> Number
          ; counts all occurrences of sy in sexp
          (define (count-sl sexp sy)
            (cond
              [(empty? sexp) 0]
              [else
                (+ (count (first sexp) sy)
                   (count-sl (rest sexp) sy))])))
  (cond
    [(number? sexp) 0 ]
    [(string? sexp) 0 ]
    [(symbol? sexp) (if (equal? sexp sy) 1 0) ]
    [else (count-sl sexp sy) ])))
{% endhighlight %}

The `count` function is really closely coupled to the the data type. According to the data type definition, an S-expression is one of a number, string, symbol, or list of S-expressions. The function uses a switch statement that checks each of these cases.

The first 3 cases are simple. If the S-expression is a number or string, then the number of symbols in it is 0. If it is a symbol, then obviously the number of symbols is 1. If the S-expression is a list, then the work is delegated to the local `count-sl` function.

The `count-sl` function is also very closely coupled to the data type, specifically the list of S-expressions sub-data type. According this definition, the list of S-expressions is an empty list or one S-expression and a list of S-expressions. This function also uses a switch statement to check both cases.

The first case is very simple: if the list is an empty list, then the number of symbols is 0.

The second case is also pretty simple. It just gets how many symbols are in the S-expression with `count` and how many are in the list of S-expressions with itself, and then adds these together.

I just find it interesting how closely the recursion of the function follows the recursion of the data, but to some this may be obvious.

My review on this book: it's a buy (actually it's free and you can read it at [htdp.org](https://htdp.org/))!
