## Books

- [Design Patterns in Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Ruby-Russ-Olsen/dp/0321490452/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NPII8XEZBIRI&keywords=design+patterns+ruby&qid=1675739319&s=books&sprefix=design+patterns+ruby%2Cstripbooks%2C100&sr=1-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840)
  - Descriptions and Ruby examples of the 14 Gang of Four software design patterns most relevant to Ruby programmers. I have not finished reading this.
- [Metaprogramming Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Pros/dp/1934356476)
  - If you have seen things like `class << self` in your code base and don't know what that means yet, I would read this book.
- [Practical Object-Oriented Design: An Agile Primer Using Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Agile-Primer/dp/0134456475/ref=pd_lpo_2?pd_rd_w=fujt0&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=Z8EPG65DMRBH054G5PM1&pd_rd_wg=XEGYO&pd_rd_r=de83e3d0-a6af-42b1-abbb-3da70ee64f75&pd_rd_i=0134456475&psc=1)
  - The lessons in this book about messages between objects, dependencies, and how to design tests improved the way I think about object-oriented programming.
- [Modern Front-End Development for Rails: Hotwire, Stimulus, Turbo, and React (1st Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Front-End-Development-Rails-Webpacker/dp/1680507214)
  - As a primarily backend web developer, I read this to learn about Hotwire. I definitely got what I needed out of it, and then some (a nice discussion on React). I have not finished reading it though.
- [Rails Anti-patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Rails-AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321604814)
  - This demonstrates many examples of what not to do in Rails 3 applications, which you should probably try to avoid in applications using newer versions of Rails too. It also has a lot of good advice about Rails in general.
- [The RSpec Book](https://www.amazon.com/RSpec-Book-Behaviour-Development-Cucumber/dp/1934356379)
  - A nice introduction to RSpec, BDD, Cucumber, and other tools for testing. Some of the syntax is outdated, but the meaning is not. The foreword by Robert Martin emphasizes one of the themes he interprets from the book, which is craftsmanship.
- [Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails](https://www.amazon.com/Service-Oriented-Design-Rails-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321659368)
  - Definitely worth reading, especially if you are a developer spending your workdays toiling on a Rails monolith and daydreaming about smaller code bases. The author also snuck in a lot of really good wisdom and information about topics related to services.
