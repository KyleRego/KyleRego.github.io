I wanted to develop a Rails app today that I thought would be useful for myself. The idea was an app that you can enter in your recipes and the amounts of ingredients that you have and it shows what recipes are currently cookable with your ingredients and creates shopping lists for ingredients that you would need to get to cook some recipes that you want to cook. I want to give an idea of what the initial development of a Rails app is like mostly for beginners to programming and people who are interested. A post like this could never explain everything from the beginning though (in the future I may write and reference articles focused on specific concepts).

The first thing I did was jot down some notes on paper on my initial idea of the app:

![Notes written on a piece of paper with a blue pen that describe the idea of pantry: Model a food inventory. Needs categories, recipes, commodity-like ingredients (water), discrete ingredients (eggs), fluid-measurable ingredients (milk), weight-measurable ingredients (chicken), boxes, expiration dates, allergies?, also macronutrients, micronutrients? Select recipes and it will compute the shopping list needed, also show which recipes are cookable and which are not. There are some other small scratch notes too.](assets/pantry/pantry-initial-notes.jpg)

After this, I created a Rails app with the `rails new` command (see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html). From a terminal and using the bash shell, I ran `rails new pantry -d postgresql --skip-test` to create the folder in the current working directory called `pantry` with the app already configured to use a PostgreSQL database cluster and skip the tests boilerplate. Later on test code using the RSpec framework can be added in. With the terminal, `cd pantry` to move into the project and `code .` to open it with Visual Studio Code.

After this, I wanted to think about the database schema that this app would use. I took three boxes that I bought earlier from the store which need some other ingredients to cook like water, eggs, milk, butter or margarine, etc. to think about this. In my opinion [the first step of program design is understanding the input data to the program](https://htdp.org/2023-8-14/Book/part_preface.html). The entity relationship diagram that I landed on eventually was this:

![An entity relationship diagram roughly outlining the data model with categories, ingredients, recipes, amounts, and units.](assets/pantry/pantry-initial-erd.jpg)

It doesn't use any conventions other than what made sense to me. It is also not accurate to what the schema will be later and there is at least one serious flaw with this ERD for this app and this database also doesn't yet take into account cooking equipment like the stove, pots, etc. that you would need to cook with, which was something I wanted to include too. Software development is not like engineering a physical system where not planning enough at the start results in a disaster and having to start over. Software can be changed gradually from what it is to what it needs to be so any issues early on in the development of a small app like this are hardly a problem.

With the initial idea of the data model, I went back to my laptop to start programming the app. First I did `git add .` to stage the initial files (the Rails app that I created earlier) and `git commit -m "New Rails app"` to commit them to the Git repo. Then I went on github.com and created a new repo called `pantry` making sure to not add an initial README file. I did `git remote add origin git@github.com:KyleRego/pantry.git` which connects the local git repo to the remote one on GitHub. Then I did `git push origin main` to push my local commit up to the remote. Then I went back to Github and from there, added the license file (TODO: link commit). Then I did `git pull origin main` to pull that second commit down to my local repo.

With the initial Rails app created and a license, the next thing I did was scaffold some more of the app. Referring to my own entity relationship diagram picture, I ran these commands:

`bin/rails generate scaffold Category name:string`

`bin/rails generate scaffold Ingredient name:string countable:boolean volumeable:boolean weighable:boolean excess:boolean category_id:integer`

`bin/rails generate scaffold Recipe name:string steps:text description:text`

`bin/rails generate scaffold Amount name:string type:string count:integer volume:float weight:float excess:boolean`

`bin/rails generate scaffold Unit name:string type:string`

These commands generate a lot of Rails boilerplate code. It includes models, controllers, views, and even migrations code. (TODO: link to commit). The `bin/rails db:migrate` command runs the migrations against the database changing the schema  to bring the database schema up to date and also dumps the resulting schema into the `db/schema.rb` file (TODO: link) like a snapshot.

Then I changed the `config/routes.rb` to route the root path to the recipes index action. This was just so visiting the app locally would show the recipes rather than the default page of a new Rails app.

Then I did `bin/rails generate migration AddIngredientsRecipesJoinTable` to generate a join table between ingredients and recipes.

Then I did many more migrations, model associations, some stuff in the Rails console

A selfie of myself that I took a couple hours into the initial development of this software project today:

![A selfie of myself](assets/pantry/selfie-2-17-2024.jpg)

I was trimming my eyebrows a little recently (I cut my own hair, or rather, I make my own head bald, so it was very overdue since I don't trim them as often) and I did do it slightly unevenly which is visible in this picture. They still look better than when they were more overgrown in my opinion though.
