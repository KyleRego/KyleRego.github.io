YouTube has a lot of great content. This linklog is a collection of different YouTube videos that I think are worth watching, depending on your interests.

## Math

- [ASTOUNDING: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... = -1/12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww)
  - Does this really make any less sense than the square root of -1?
- [Chaos \| Chapter 7 : Strange Attractors - The butterfly effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAJkLh76QnM)
  - This is a beautiful short movie about how mathematical chaos followed from modeling of the atmosphere. This lead to the idea of the butterfly effect, but that idea is not the whole story.

## Video games

- [Detroit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww_A0Mzw1EE)
  - The most entertaining playthrough of a video game on the platform.

## The most American guy living in Korea

- [Coke vs. Pepsi Blind Taste Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_-LTS2Iobg)
