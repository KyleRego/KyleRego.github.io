[SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru) has the highest density of wrong, but interesting models of any MediaWiki instance on the web (in my opinion).

- [Value of wrong models](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Value_of_wrong_models)
  - *There are ways of being wrong that help others to be right.* - Ian McEwan
  - [All models are wrong (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)
- [Learntropy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy)
- [War of the networks](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks)
  - This models many different things, including this example of a theoretical conflict happening between neural networks in the brain of a student learning from bad teachers who are interfering with the development of clear, coherent mental models:
