[SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru) has the highest density of wrong (but interesting) models of any MediaWiki instance on the web (in my opinion). You thought Wikipedia was a bad source to cite?

- [Learntropy](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy)
  - This concept may be a helpful mental model.
- [War of the networks](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/War_of_the_networks)
  - This process is described as having consequences in "phenomena that are too many to list" which must be a lot because the "overlapping phenomena involved in the process are [a list of about 20 different biological processes]" was not too many to list.
- [Two components of sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_components_of_sleep)
  - I think that (for most healthy people) falling asleep easily is related to alignment with the circadian rhythm (adjusted by the suprachiasmatic nucleus sampling light sensory input) and hormonal pressure due to adenosine (to which caffeine is an antagonist).
- [Abstract knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge)

## Interesting figures
