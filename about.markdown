I am a web developer who currently works with Ruby on Rails. Before I got into software development I was planning on becoming a doctor, and worked a few years combined on an ambulance and as a medical scribe before going to and leaving medical school. Prior to that I got my BS in Physics from RPI in Troy, New York. Some of my hobbies include reading, listening to audiobooks, exercising, and trying to learn Japanese.
