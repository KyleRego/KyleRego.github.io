# KyleRego.github.io

This repository has the assets of my personal website which can be seen live here: [kylerego.github.io](https://kylerego.github.io).

The Jekyll theme (a fork of [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)) is in a separate repository: [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss).

The original website served at this URL and AnkiRecord gem API documentation are included as git submodules.

## git submodule notes

To pull in new commits from the remote submodule repositories:

```
git submodule update --remote
```
