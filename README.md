# KyleRego.github.io

This repo contains the Markdown files and assets of my Jekyll website: [kylerego.github.io](https://kylerego.github.io). It also includes this URL's original website as a git submodule.

The theme, a fork of [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss), is in a separate repository: [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss).
