This repository has the markdown assets of my personal website.

The Jekyll theme (a fork of [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)) is in a separate repository: [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss). (That repo has an earlier but very similar version, as I found it more convenient to include the theme and assets in the same repo, which is now this one.)

The original version of this website and Anki Record API documentation are included as git submodules.

## git submodule notes

To pull in new commits from the remote submodule repositories:

```
git submodule update --remote
```
