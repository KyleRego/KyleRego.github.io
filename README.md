# KyleRego.github.io

Here are the Markdown files and assets of my Jekyll website found here: [kylerego.github.io](https://kylerego.github.io). The original website served at this URI is included as a git submodule.

The theme (a fork of [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)) is in a separate repository: [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss).
