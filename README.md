# KyleRego.github.io

This repository has the markdown assets of my personal website.

The Jekyll theme (a fork of [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)) is in a separate repository: [KyleRego/swiss](https://github.com/KyleRego/swiss).

The original version of this website and Anki Record API documentation are included as git submodules.

## git submodule notes

To pull in new commits from the remote submodule repositories:

```
git submodule update --remote
```
