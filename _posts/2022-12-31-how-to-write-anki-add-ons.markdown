The purpose of this post is to show a few examples of Anki add-ons I wrote while I was in medical school. I hope this will be helpful to someone new to programming who wants to write an Anki add-on. This post also condenses the content of three separate posts on this topic. The exact content of the three original posts can be seen in [the commit which deleted them](https://github.com/KyleRego/KyleRego.github.io/commit/f3e5b60c401b72c124ffd693e3dd707b47fd609e). Before the case studies, I also want to provide some background on what you may need to study to write Anki add-ons in general.

# Background

There are two topics to familiarize yourself with to write an Anki add-on: Python and PyQt. Python is one of the most popular programming languages and a very good one for people who want to get things done quickly. Qt (pronounced "cute") is a C++ library for creating cross-platform graphical user interfaces. PyQt lets you use Qt through Python.

For Python, I recommend [Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280). The first 200 pages or so teach Python and are all you really need to read. The rest of the book is about completing projects which could be a fun time if you find yourself enjoying Python.

For PyQt, I did consult [Create GUI Applications with Python & PyQt5](https://leanpub.com/create-simple-gui-applications). I recommend reading this once you have identified you need a deeper understanding of PyQt to make progress on your add-on.

You will also have to refer to the official documentation. Unfortunately, I found that the PyQt docs were somewhat incomplete compared to the Qt documentation. Eventually I was only reading the Qt docs. Since Qt is a C++ library and not Python, it takes some time to understand how to read its documentation to understand PyQt.

I also recommend checking out [Anki Scripting For Non-programmers](https://www.juliensobczak.com/write/2020/12/26/anki-scripting-for-non-programmers.html). This is a really good article about writing Python scripts that create Anki flashcards. 

The last resource is the [official documentation about writing Anki add-ons](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/). This has the most up-to-date information about what you need to do and you're probably going to be reading this a lot as you write your add-on.

# Case study: the Anki magnifying glass mouse cursor

Let's take a look at the source code of the [Anki magnifying glass mouse cursor](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/842653376). If you install this add-on in the usual way, you can navigate to the source code through Anki. From the Add-ons widget just select the add-on and click the View Files button. Here is the `__init__.py` file:

{% highlight Python %}
from aqt import mw
from aqt.qt import *

config = mw.addonManager.getConfig(__name__)
zoomwidth = zoomheight = config["larger square side length (pixels)"]
width = height = config["smaller square side length (pixels)"]
pos_x_crosshair = config["positive-x crosshair length (pixels)"]
neg_x_crosshair = config["negative-x crosshair length (pixels)"]
pos_y_crosshair = config["positive-y crosshair length (pixels)"]
neg_y_crosshair = config["negative-y crosshair length (pixels)"]
timeout_interval = config["delay to turn off zoom mouse (milliseconds)"]

cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut = 10

class AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor():
    def __init__(self):
        self.timer = QTimer(mw)
        self.timer.setSingleShot(True)
        self.timer.timeout.connect(self.reset_zoom_mouse)
        self.cursors_on_stack = 0

    def handle_zoom_mouse_shortcut(self):
        self.persist_zoom_mouse()
        self.timer.start(timeout_interval)

    def persist_zoom_mouse(self):
        i = 0
        while i < cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut:
            parent: AnkiQt = mw
            point1: QPoint = QCursor.pos()
            point2: QPoint = parent.mapFromGlobal(point1)
            size = QSize(width, height)
            rectangle = QRect(point2, size)
            rectangle.moveCenter(point2)
            pixmap1: QPixmap = parent.grab(rectangle)

            painter = QPainter(pixmap1)
            midx, midy = width/2, height/2
            painter.drawLine(midx, midy-pos_y_crosshair, midx, midy+neg_y_crosshair)
            painter.drawLine(midx-neg_x_crosshair, midy, midx+pos_x_crosshair, midy)
            painter.end()

            enlarged_pixmap = pixmap1.scaled(zoomwidth, zoomheight)
            newcursor = QCursor(enlarged_pixmap)
            mw.app.setOverrideCursor(newcursor)
            i += 1
        self.cursors_on_stack += cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut

    def reset_zoom_mouse(self):
        while self.cursors_on_stack > 0:
            mw.app.restoreOverrideCursor()
            self.cursors_on_stack -= 1

anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor = AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor()

action = QAction("Zoom Mouse", mw)
action.setShortcut("Alt+C")
action.triggered.connect(anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor.handle_zoom_mouse_shortcut)
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
{% endhighlight %}

There is also a `config.json` file:

{% highlight json %}
{
"larger square side length (pixels)": 400, 
"smaller square side length (pixels)": 200,
"positive-x crosshair length (pixels)": 5,
"negative-x crosshair length (pixels)": 5,
"positive-y crosshair length (pixels)": 5,
"negative-y crosshair length (pixels)": 5,
"delay to turn off zoom mouse (milliseconds)": 500
}
{% endhighlight %}

## What does this add-on do?

This add-on adds a keyboard shortcut to Anki:

- Alt + C:
  - The following happens 10 times:
    - A pixel map is made from a small square of the Anki window centered at the instantaneous position of the mouse cursor.
    - A small + is drawn onto the center of this pixel map (the crosshairs).
    - A second pixel map is made by enlarging the first pixel map.
    - The mouse cursor on the screen, and inside the Anki window, becomes the second pixel map.

By holding Alt + C, the mouse cursor will always be showing a magnified picture of the screen at the mouse cursor position. When this keyboard shortcut is released, after a short delay, the mouse cursor resets.

If you are testing this add-on and notice that the cursor resets once while holding Alt + C and then stays on afterwards, this may be because of a keyboard shortcut repeat delay, which you can change in your operating system settings.

## The Python imports

{% highlight Python %}
from aqt import mw
from aqt.qt import *
{% endhighlight %}

This is just importing parts of Anki into our add-on so that we can use them. `mw` is the Anki main window object. An object is an instance of a class. When an object is created using a class as the template, we say it was instantiated. The class defines what data and behavior the objects instantiated from it have.

The Anki main window object's class is `AnkiQt`. An important feature of classes and object-oriented programming is inheritance. This allows a class to inherit the data and behavior of another class, which it can then add to or override. `AnkiQt` inherits from the Qt class `QMainWindow`. We will see later that we can ask `mw` for the Anki collection.

## Reading config.json

{% highlight Python %}
config = mw.addonManager.getConfig(__name__)
zoomwidth = zoomheight = config["larger square side length (pixels)"]
width = height = config["smaller square side length (pixels)"]
pos_x_crosshair = config["positive-x crosshair length (pixels)"]
neg_x_crosshair = config["negative-x crosshair length (pixels)"]
pos_y_crosshair = config["positive-y crosshair length (pixels)"]
neg_y_crosshair = config["negative-y crosshair length (pixels)"]
timeout_interval = config["delay to turn off zoom mouse (milliseconds)"]
{% endhighlight %}

This is generally how Anki add-ons can read in values from a configuration file. The user is able to edit these values from inside Anki. There is one constant in the program that cannot be edited by the user, unless they directly edit it in the source code:

{% highlight Python %}
cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut = 10
{% endhighlight %}

We will see what this means later.

It is a good idea to define any constant values at the beginning of the program. We could instead replace every reference to `cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut` with the literal 10; this would be considered a magic number. By defining the value in one place and referencing it, we avoid having to make changes to many places in the code when we are essentially changing one thing.

## Registering the actions

{% highlight Python %}
anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor = AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor()

action = QAction("Zoom Mouse", mw)
action.setShortcut("Alt+C")
action.triggered.connect(anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor.handle_zoom_mouse_shortcut)
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
{% endhighlight %}

There are two examples here showing how to instantiate an object in Python. `anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor` is instantiated from the `AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor` class, and `action` is instantiated from the `QAction` class, which we get from PyQt/Qt. The reason why `action` is instantiated with some arguments `"Zoom Mouse"` and the Anki main window object and the other object is not has to do with the definitions of the class constructors. 

The constructor of a class is a method that is called when an object is instantiated from the class and its purpose is to set up the object. When we study the `AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor` class later, we will see its constructor does not need any arguments.

The `QAction` class represents an abstraction for user commands. We have instantiated one with some descriptive text and a parent object, the Anki main window object.

Then we do three things: 
- We specify that this action should be triggered with the keyboard shortcut Alt + C.
- We specify that the `handle_zoom_mouse_shortcut` method of `anki_magnifying_glass_mouse_cursor` should run when the action is triggered.
- We add this action so that it can be triggered from the menu tools.

![Anki tools menu with the zoom mouse action](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-zoom-mouse-tool-menu-option.png)

## The Anki Magnifying Glass Mouse Cursor class and constructor

{% highlight Python %}
class AnkiMagnifyingGlassMouseCursor():
    def __init__(self):
        self.timer = QTimer(mw)
        self.timer.setSingleShot(True)
        self.timer.timeout.connect(self.reset_zoom_mouse)
        self.cursors_on_stack = 0
{% endhighlight %}

This first line shows how to start the definition of a class in Python, and the rest is the constructor, which in Python is called `__init__` and takes `self`, which represents the object it is constructing, as the first argument.

The constructor generally defines what data an object instantiated from the class should have. In this case, it is giving it a timer which itself is an instance of `QTimer`. The argument to the constructor, `mw`, becomes the parent of the `QTimer`. This wasn't strictly necessary but may help Qt manage memory. `mw` is available here without needing to be passed in explicitly because of the variable scoping rules of Python.

`QTimer` is a Qt class that emits a signal every `interval` milliseconds. The documentation refers to the `QTimer` emitting this signal as timing out. The `setSingleShot` method sets an attribute of the `QTimer` object that indicates it should only time out once.

{% highlight Python %}
self.timer.timeout.connect(self.reset_zoom_mouse)
{% endhighlight %}

This specifies that the `reset_zoom_mouse` function should run when the timer emits the signal. Therefore, when the timer times out, the zoom mouse will be reset.

{% highlight Python %}
self.cursors_on_stack = 0
{% endhighlight %}

This is related to the `cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut` variable that we defined in the beginning. Again, we will see what these are doing later.

## The handle zoom mouse shortcut method

{% highlight Python %}
def handle_zoom_mouse_shortcut(self):
    self.persist_zoom_mouse()
    self.timer.start(timeout_interval)
{% endhighlight %}

This is the method that runs when the action we defined is triggered. Calling `start` on a timer that is already on stops it and restarts it. Every trigger of Alt + C causes the `persist_zoom_mouse` method to be called and also resets the timer that triggers `reset_zoom_mouse`.

## persist_zoom_mouse

{% highlight Python %}
def persist_zoom_mouse(self):
    i = 0
    while i < cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut:
        parent: AnkiQt = mw
        point1: QPoint = QCursor.pos()
        point2: QPoint = parent.mapFromGlobal(point1)
        size = QSize(width, height)
        rectangle = QRect(point2, size)
        rectangle.moveCenter(point2)
        pixmap1: QPixmap = parent.grab(rectangle)

        painter = QPainter(pixmap1)
        midx, midy = width/2, height/2
        painter.drawLine(midx, midy-pos_y_crosshair, midx, midy+neg_y_crosshair)
        painter.drawLine(midx-neg_x_crosshair, midy, midx+pos_x_crosshair, midy)
        painter.end()

        enlarged_pixmap = pixmap1.scaled(zoomwidth, zoomheight)
        newcursor = QCursor(enlarged_pixmap)
        mw.app.setOverrideCursor(newcursor)
        i += 1
    self.cursors_on_stack += cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut
{% endhighlight %}

The important part of this function is the body of the `while` loop. We'll look at it line by line.

{% highlight Python %}
parent: AnkiQt = mw
{% endhighlight %}

This just makes a variable `parent` also pointing to the Anki main window object. `mw` is in scope inside the function even though it wasn't passed as an argument due to the scoping rules of Python. Having two variables referencing this object was probably unnecessary (oops).

This is also showing a type hint. It doesn't do anything but provide some documentation that the `parent` variable is an instance of `AnkiQt`.

{% highlight Python %}
point1: QPoint = QCursor.pos()
point2: QPoint = parent.mapFromGlobal(point1)
{% endhighlight %}

This is a good time to talk about how to read the Qt documentation. Take a look at [QCursor::pos()](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qcursor.html#pos). Here are the relevant bits:

> QPoint QCursor::pos()

> Returns the position of the cursor (hot spot) of the primary screen in global screen coordinates.

`::` in the Qt documentation means `.` in Python. This is a static method which means it's called on the class itself, not an instance of the class. The class on the left is the type of the returned value.

The documentation also notes this:

> You can call QWidget::mapFromGlobal() to translate it to widget coordinates.

This one is not a static method, so we call it on `parent`, which references the Anki main window object. `QWidget` is inherited by a lot of other classes in Qt, including `QMainWindow`, which is the parent class of `AnkiQt`. Therefore `AnkiQt` inherits this method from `QWidget`.

This method is also overloaded, which means we can pass it different combinations of arguments. It will determine the correct implementation of the method to use from the types of the arguments you pass it. A lot of the Qt methods are like this. This is why earlier we could have just as well instantiated the `QTimer` object without passing it `mw` as an argument.

Comparing the Python methods to their Qt documentation will help a lot in order to understand the Qt documentation for methods you don't have Python examples of.

{% highlight Python %}
size = QSize(width, height)
rectangle  = QRect(point2, size)
rectangle.moveCenter(point2)
{% endhighlight %}

Here we make a rectangle, which is represented by a top-left corner and a size. Instead of calculating what the top-left corner of a rectangle centered at the point should be, we make a rectangle with its top-left coordinate at that point and then move the rectangle such that the point becomes its center.

{% highlight Python %}
pixmap1: QPixmap = parent.grab(rectangle)
{% endhighlight %}

This makes an object which represents a map of the pixels on the screen specified by the rectangle we made.

{% highlight Python %}
painter = QPainter(pixmap1)
midx, midy = width/2, height/2
painter.drawLine(midx, midy-5, midx, midy+5)
painter.drawLine(midx-5, midy, midx+5, midy)
painter.end()
{% endhighlight %}

This draws the crosshairs. Notice how the constructor for the `QPainter` object takes the pixel map as an argument. Since the coordinate system assumes a top-left corner, the positive-y direction is down. `width` and `height` are the width and height of the square so dividing them by 2 gives the center coordinates of the square. All we have to do is draw short horizontal and vertical lines through that point to make the crosshairs.

{% highlight Python %}
enlarged_pixmap = pixmap1.scaled(zoomwidth, zoomheight)
{% endhighlight %}

This makes a pixel map which is just an enlarged version of the first one.

{% highlight Python %}
newcursor = QCursor(enlarged_pixmap)
mw.app.setOverrideCursor(newcursor)
{% endhighlight %}

This makes a mouse cursor where the image of it is our pixel map, and then sets the "application override cursor" to be this cursor.

From reading the Qt documentation, the cursors are stored on a stack. This data structure is like a stack of books on a table--you can put a book on top, and you can take the top book off. `setOverrideCursor` pushes a cursor onto the stack. `cursors_pushed_to_stack_per_shortcut` is exactly what it sounds like, and `self.cursors_on_stack` keeps track of how many cursors are on the stack.

## reset_zoom_mouse

{% highlight Python %}
def reset_zoom_mouse(self):
    while self.cursors_on_stack > 0:
        mw.app.restoreOverrideCursor()
        self.cursors_on_stack -= 1
{% endhighlight %}

This method resets the mouse to its normal state. The `restoreOverrideCursor` method pops the active cursor off the stack.

# Case study: the Anki enumeration tool

The second add-on we will look at is the [Anki enumeration tool](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/268751365). This add-on is somewhat flawed, but at least one person found it useful:

![A review of the Anki enumeration tool](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-enumeration-tool-review.png)

It is at least as useful an example of an Anki add-on as the first case study.

## What does this add-on do?

"Enumeration tool" is added to the Tools (the images are from an older version of the add-on where it was "OSCE Notes Maker" instead):

![Anki tools menu with the enumeration tool](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-enumeration-tool-button.png)

Here is what you get by clicking the button (except the fields would all be empty--I have filled them out here):

![The special enumeration note-making window](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-osce-notes-maker-filled-out.png)

There is no deck called Temporary, but there is a note type called Basic. Clicking the Create Notes button creates a Temporary deck and makes three notes:

![The enumeration notes made by the add-on](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-enumeration-notes.png)

The Basic note type isn't a cloze deletion type so these notes won't work, but the more serious problem is that the information is repeated over three notes. Each of the three notes creates one card. What you actually want is one note creating three cards--this is the biggest flaw with this add-on. 

Because the Anki data structure is not being used correctly, if you make an enumeration with N steps, you have N notes each with N steps instead of 1 note with N steps. In the worst-case scenario, if you wanted to edit all N steps, you have to edit N steps for N notes.

It's [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) being violated by Anki notes.  Even with bulk note editing, the Anki notes made by this add-on are hard to maintain. You could probably get the same functionality as this add-on without this problem by creating a custom note type or card type for enumerations.

## Registering the action

Just like with the magnifying glass, we make an action, add it to the Tools, and connect it to a function:

{% highlight Python %}
action = QAction()
action.setText("Enumeration tool")
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
action.triggered.connect(showoscedialog)
{% endhighlight %}

## showoscedialog

I really should have given this function a better name (oops).

{% highlight Python %}
osce_dialog = OsceDialog(mw)

def showoscedialog() -> None:
    osce_dialog.show()
{% endhighlight %}

This makes an instance of the `OsceDialog` class--the superclass of `OsceDialog` is `QDialog`, which is another Qt class which inherits from `QWidget`, which is where `show` comes from. This method just causes the widget, and any of its child widgets, to be shown.

## The OsceDialog class and constructor

{% highlight Python %}
class OsceDialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self):
        QDialog.__init__(self)
        self.setWindowTitle("Enumeration tool")
        self.layout = QVBoxLayout()

        label1 = QLabel("Enter lines below, each line goes into {{c1::line}} in a note")
        self.noteseditor = QPlainTextEdit()
        self.layout.addWidget(label1)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.noteseditor)

        label2 = QLabel("Enter name of deck below")
        self.deck_taker = QLineEdit()
        self.layout.addWidget(label2)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.deck_taker)

        label3 = QLabel("Enter name of note type below")
        self.notetype_taker = QLineEdit()
        self.layout.addWidget(label3)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.notetype_taker)

        label4 = QLabel("Enter title below")
        self.tag_taker = QLineEdit()
        self.layout.addWidget(label4)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.tag_taker)

        label5 = QLabel("Press button below to make notes")
        self.button = QPushButton("Create notes")
        self.button.clicked.connect(self.makeNotes)
        self.layout.addWidget(label5)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.button)

        self.setLayout(self.layout)
{% endhighlight %}

This class represents the enumeration creation window.

{% highlight Python %}
class OsceDialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self):
        QDialog.__init__(self)
{% endhighlight %}

What is different about this class is we are inheriting the `QDialog` class. The first thing the constructor does is call the constructor of the parent class which is necessary to set up the object correctly.

{% highlight Python %}
self.setWindowTitle("Enumeration tool")
{% endhighlight %}

This sets the title of the window. It's similar to the `<title>` element in HTML. `self` is the object we are constructing. In general `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class.

{% highlight Python %}
self.layout = QVBoxLayout()
{% endhighlight %}

Here we are giving the object a `layout` attribute which is an instance of `QVBoxLayout`, a Qt class which is used to line up widgets vertically.

{% highlight Python %}
label1 = QLabel("Enter lines below, each line goes into  in a note")
{% endhighlight %}

This makes the first label.

{% highlight Python %}
self.noteseditor = QPlainTextEdit()
{% endhighlight %}

This instantiates an object from the `QPlainTextEdit` class and creates an attribute of the object we are making, `self.noteseditor`, which references it. This becomes the multiline text field where we enter the steps of the enumeration.

{% highlight Python %}
self.layout.addWidget(label1)
self.layout.addWidget(self.noteseditor)
{% endhighlight %}

This adds the label and multi-line text editor we made to the layout.

{% highlight Python %}
label2 = QLabel("Enter name of deck below")
self.deck_taker = QLineEdit()
self.layout.addWidget(label2)
self.layout.addWidget(self.deck_taker)

label3 = QLabel("Enter name of note type below")
self.notetype_taker = QLineEdit()
self.layout.addWidget(label3)
self.layout.addWidget(self.notetype_taker)

label4 = QLabel("Enter title below")
self.tag_taker = QLineEdit()
self.layout.addWidget(label4)
self.layout.addWidget(self.tag_taker)
{% endhighlight %}

All of this is pretty similar to what we already saw except for the `QLineEdit` class, which is just a single line text field.

{% highlight Python %}
label5 = QLabel("Press button below to make notes")
self.button = QPushButton("Create notes")
self.button.clicked.connect(self.makeNotes)
self.layout.addWidget(label5)
self.layout.addWidget(self.button)
{% endhighlight %}

The unique thing here is the button class and the line specifying that clicking the button will trigger the `makeNotes` method of the object we are constructing.

{% highlight Python %}
self.setLayout(layout)
{% endhighlight %}

The `setLayout` method comes from `QWidget` and takes an argument of type `QLayout`. `QLayout` is inherited by `QBoxLayout`, which is inherited by `QVBoxLayout`, so this works. The argument becomes the layout manager for the receiver of the method.

## makeNotes

{% highlight Python %}
def makeNotes(self):
    notetype_name: str = self.notetype_taker.text()
    model_to_use: Union[None, NoteType] = mw.col.models.byName(notetype_name)
    if model_to_use is None:
        outstring = "Unable to find the specified note type."
        outstring += "\nPlease enter the name of a note type that exists.\nNo cards are being made."
        showInfo(outstring)
        return False

    title: str = self.tag_taker.text()

    deck_name: str = self.deck_taker.text()
    did = mw.col.decks.id(deck_name)
    mw.col.decks.select(did)
    deck = mw.col.decks.get(did)

    notes_content: Sequence[str] = make_osce_notes(self.noteseditor.toPlainText())

    model_to_use['did'] = did
    mw.col.models.save(model_to_use)

    deck['mid'] = model_to_use['id']
    mw.col.decks.save(deck)

    for content in notes_content:
        new_note: Note = mw.col.newNote()
        new_note.fields[0] = title + "<br>" + content
        mw.col.addNote(new_note)
    showInfo("Cards created successfully.")
{% endhighlight %}

We saw above that this method will be called when clicking the button.

{% highlight Python %}
notetype_name: str = self.notetype_taker.text()
{% endhighlight %}

This just grabs the text input entered for the note type and assigns it to a variable.

{% highlight Python %}
model_to_use: Union[None, NoteType] = mw.col.models.byName(notetype_name)
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing to notice is the use of a union type in the type hint. `model_to_use` can be `None` if no note type is found or it can be an instance of the Anki class `NoteType`.

With this we are also starting to get out of the Qt stuff and into the Anki data structure. `mw.col` is the `Collection` object--the official Anki add-on writing documentation has a lot to say about this. Here it is giving us access into the note types and also letting us ask for one by name. In the Anki source, model is another term for note type.

{% highlight Python %}
if model_to_use is None:
    outstring = "Unable to find the specified note type."
    outstring += "\nPlease enter the name of a note type that exists.\nNo cards are being made."
    showInfo(outstring)
    return False
{% endhighlight %}

The `showInfo` function is a nice helper that does this:

![The output of the showInfo function](/assets/anki-add-on-images/anki-enumeration-tool-model-not-found-info.png)

So if the user enters something for the name of a note type which is not a note type in their Anki collection, they get this message.

{% highlight Python %}
title: str = self.tag_taker.text()

deck_name: str = self.deck_taker.text()
{% endhighlight %}

These lines are just getting the title of the cards to create and name of the deck to put them in in the same way as we got the note type name.

{% highlight Python %}
did = mw.col.decks.id(deck_name)
{% endhighlight %}

Here we again using the Anki collection object which we can ask the Anki main window for. This object's `decks` attribute is an instance of the `DeckManager` class. This has a method `id` which, as we see here, can take a deck name string argument and return the id of that deck.

{% highlight Python %}
mw.col.decks.select(did)
{% endhighlight %}

This finds a deck by id and sets that to be the current deck.

{% highlight Python %}
deck = mw.col.decks.get(did)
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have the current deck assigned to a variable. I think this object is an instance of `DeckDict`.

{% highlight Python %}
notes_content: Sequence[str] = make_osce_notes(self.noteseditor.toPlainText())
{% endhighlight %}

This is where the input from the multiline text field gets converted to the contents of the notes--we will look at the `make_osce_notes` function later.

{% highlight Python %}
model_to_use['did'] = did
mw.col.models.save(model_to_use)
{% endhighlight %}

This sets the deck id of the note type and persists the update to the database.

{% highlight Python %}
deck['mid'] = model_to_use['id']
mw.col.decks.save(deck)
{% endhighlight %}

I had to also set the model id of the deck to be the model's id.

I think this was probably necessary due to the default way Anki decides what model to use and what deck to put new notes in. It may be that the model used is determined by the current model of the selected deck and the deck that notes are added to is determined by the last deck used by the model.

{% highlight Python %}
for content in notes_content:
    new_note: Note = mw.col.newNote()
    new_note.fields[0] = title + "<br>" + content
    mw.col.addNote(new_note)
{% endhighlight %}

This is where the notes are made. Note how we don't specify here what model to use for the new note or what deck to put it in. The `<br>` is the [line break HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br)--it prevents the title and first line of the content from being on the same line.

Reading the source, it looks like `newNote` is deprecated and `new_note` (a method called `new_note`--not the variable I called `new_note` above) should be used instead. Both are methods of `Collection` but it looks like `new_note` takes the model to use as an argument instead of just defaulting to the current model of the selected deck.

## make_osce_notes

The details of this function aren't important. It takes an input like `"1\n2\n3"` and returns a Python list like {% raw %}`["1: {{c1::1}}", "1: 1<br>2: {{c2::2}}", 1: 1<br>2: 2<br>3: {{c1::3}}"]`{% endraw %} which becomes the `notes_content` in `makeNotes`. The `a` parameter should probably have a more descriptive name.

{% highlight Python %}
def make_osce_notes(a: str) -> Sequence[str]:
    string_list: Sequence[str] = a.split('\n')
    out_list = []
    for line in string_list:
        important_line = line
        index_of_line = string_list.index(line)
        if index_of_line == 0:
            out_list.append(f"{1}: {{ "{{{{c1::{important_line"}}}}}}}")
        if index_of_line > 0:
            not_important_lines = string_list[:index_of_line]
            outstring = ""
            i = 1
            for notimportline in not_important_lines:
                outstring += f"{i}: {notimportline}<br>"
                i += 1
            outstring += f"{i}: {{ "{{{{c1::{important_line"}}}}}}}"
            out_list.append(outstring)

    return out_list
{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusion

Hopefully these examples will help you understand the tools which are at your disposal to write your own Anki add-on. I'm also not a Pythonista, so if I wrote something that is incorrect, please let me know. A pull request to improve the article would also be very welcome. Cheers, and remember if you are stuck writing your add-on, take a step back and sleep on it. When you work on it again, consider it an opportunity to learn.
