Today I decided to turn my website into a Jekyll blog, using the [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) theme. I think the posts will mostly be book reviews.

[The old version]({% link the-old-website/index.html %}) included a [snake game]({% link the-old-website/snake/index.html %}) and a [photo gallery of Maisie]({% link the-old-website/maisie/index.html %}).

More to come soon.
